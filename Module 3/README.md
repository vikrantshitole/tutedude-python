**Python Basics â€“ Two Simple Tasks**
This repository contains two beginner-level Python programs:

Task 1: Check whether a number is even or odd

Task 2: Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 50

**ðŸ“Œ Task 1: Even or Odd Number Checker**

This program takes an integer input from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd.

**âœ… How It Works**

Takes user input

Uses the modulus operator % to check if the number is divisible by 2

Prints whether the number is even or odd

**ðŸ’» Example**

Enter a number: 7

7 is an odd number.

**ðŸ“Œ Task 2: Sum of Numbers from 1 to 50**

This program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.

**âœ… How It Works**

Initializes a sum variable at 0

Iterates from 1 to 50 using range()

Adds each number to the sum

Prints the total

**ðŸ’» Output**

The sum of numbers 1 to 50 is: 1275

**ðŸš€ How to Run the Code**

Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.x recommended).

Save the code in a .py file (e.g., tasks.py).

Run the file in your terminal or IDE:

task2.py
