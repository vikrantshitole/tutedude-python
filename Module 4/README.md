# Module 4: Functions & Modules in Python

This project contains two tasks demonstrating the use of functions and modules in Python.

---

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

### âœ… Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

### ðŸ’¡ Example

If the function is called with `5`, the output will be:

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

### âœ… Problem Statement

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the `math` module to calculate the:
   - Square root of the number
   - Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
   - Sine of the number (in radians)
3. Displays the calculated results.

### ðŸ’¡ Example

If the user inputs `25`, the output will be:
